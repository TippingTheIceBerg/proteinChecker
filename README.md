Purpose to create a library for protein use, sometimes user availability to proteins are limited so being able to create your own library of protein leads to lots of personal availability,

Some big aspects for protein that I want to include into this project will include 
1. Biggest thing for protein is the fat, protein amount, and carbs
2. Carbs provide mental and physical energy.
3. Fats keep normal hormonal and health metrics up.
4. Some tips, usually more protein per calorie is good, IE 160 calories with 7 grams of protein vs another one tht is 180 calories but 20 grams of protein
5. If more fat than protein, then it's most likely a candy bar
