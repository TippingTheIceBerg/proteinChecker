biggest thing for protein is the fat, protein amount, and carbs
protein to build/spare muscle.
Carbs provide mental and physical energy.
Fats keep normal hormonal and health metrics up.
some tips, usually more protein per calorie is good, IE 160 calories with 7 grams of protein vs another one tht is 180 calories but 20 grams of protein
if more fat than protein, then it's most likely a candy bar
